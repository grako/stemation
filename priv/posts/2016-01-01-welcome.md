Welcome to STEMation.com! I am an Ethiopian-American engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley. My race and gender was not something that I gave much attention to as an engineering student. I was quite fortunate to grow up with a father that encouraged me to take things apart and try to put them back together. As a mentor and instructor, I have become much more aware of my gender and race as well as the challenges faced by women and colored students in my classroom. 

There have been numerous articles in the last few years about the low representation of women and minorities at top positions, whether it is in engineering, academia, business, or politics. Knowing there is a problem is only part of the battle. There are many organizations that are trying various methods to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. My reason for starting this blog is to identify what companies, schools, and foundations are doing to provide a more diverse future workforce.

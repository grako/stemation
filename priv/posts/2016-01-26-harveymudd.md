Last week I had the opportunity to attend a seminar by [Harvey Mudd's](//hmc.edu/) President, [Dr. Maria Klawe](//nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/giving-women-the-access-code.html?_r=0). The seminar focused on her work in improving diversity in computer science (CS). 

**Demystifying the path to success**

The path to success is not always clear. Whether in academia or business, women have lower rates of [sponsorship](//hbr.org/2010/09/why-men-still-get-more-promotions-than-women); making `moving up' quite obscure.

*``If you're a member of the dominate group you have access to information through your network that people who are not in the dominate group don't have.''*
-- Dr. Maria Klawe

Dr. Klawe started off the seminar with the above remark, which reminded me of my time as a graduate student at the [University of Pennsylvania](//www.penn.edu). During my first year, I met many students that had opportunities to perform research either for course credit or through a summer internship. When I was an undergraduate student at the [University of Maryland](//umd.edu), I did not think I was missing out on internship opportunities. I also did not know about summer research programs that would have provided a summer research stipend. I looked for paid research positions, but now that I am in the world of academic research I understand why I could never find any open positions. Ignorance is bliss, until enlightenment.

*How did Harvey Mudd College demystify the path to success?* They developed a research program to connect female undergraduate students with female researchers. By interacting and working with female researchers, students had a role model and mentor showing them that, `yes, women can be successful scientists'. I do believe there's something powerful behind this strategy. Both my PhD and faculty mentor are highly successful women, and I talk regularly with them to learn about how they navigated through the early years of their career. 

**Creativity and Community**

Carnegie Mellon University ([CMU](//cmu.edu/)), the University of British Columbia ([UBC](//ubc.ca)), Harvey Mudd, and [Cal Poly](//calpoly.edu) have all increased the number of women in their CS programs. Some of them have had remarkable success -- from 10% to 40% in less than 10 years! *What did they do???*

Dr. Klawe noted that many of these departments changed their Introduction to Computer Science/Introduction to Programming class to make it *more inviting*. I believe the more common term for a difficult lower-level class is a `weed-out class'; any change to make a class more inviting has my vote. 

For example, Harvey Mudd revamped the Introduction to Programming courses (Java based) to a Python-based course. Students have a strong interest in learning some amount of Python, especially students in the Bay Area. With one course under their belt they can get a summer internship at one of the many tech companies in the area. They also included a Python course geared towards biologists, whereby students can solve biology problems using a computer -- that is definitely more inviting! 

As an instructor for UC Berkeley's Introduction to Programming for Engineers ([Matlab](//mathworks.com/products/matlab/)-based), I am always trying to add interesting problems that students can see the direct impact of rather than abstract problems. This year I included a piece of my own research in biomechanics as a homework assignment. I think it went well, but as with any change in the education process, it's hard to tell what impact, if any, was made by including biomechanics and biology related problems.

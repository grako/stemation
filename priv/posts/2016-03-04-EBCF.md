National Engineers Week (EWeek) started in 1951 by the [National Society of Professional Engineers](//www.nspe.org/) and another eventful Eweek has passed us by (Feb. 21-27th). Each year, Eweek is filled with outreach events aimed at introducing students to the wonderful world of engineering, with a mission to "[...ensure a diverse and well-educated future engineering workforce...](//www.nspe.org/resources/partners-and-state-societies/national-engineers-week)". 

Programs such as "Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day" occur on college campuses and elsewhere throughout the country. As a volunteer at these types of events, I feel good about giving back and hope that my story may inspire at least one student to consider a career in engineering. However, I do wonder what long-term impact these short exposure programs may have the diversity of the future workforce. The number of female and under-represented minorities has certainly increased since 1951. However, improvement has been slow in most fields, and, unfortunately, some fields have seen a recent decline in the number of female students (e.g., [computer science](http://stemation.com/blog/oracle.html)).

** More than just a day **

The one-day-a-year events seem to leave students wanting more -- more information, more projects, and more activities. That's great!... as long as there is a way to follow up with these students. Outreach programs that interact with students for longer than a day or a week require a lot of commitment from volunteers, so many programs tend to leave it to the students and parents to follow-up on finding additional engineering-like programs and activities.

In looking for a better, more substantial, way to give back to my community -- both the engineering community and my home ([Oakland, CA](//www2.oaklandnet.com/)), I stumbled upon the East Bay College Fund ([EBCF](//www.eastbaycollegefund.org/)) through a city government newsletter. The EBCF helps under-represented students in higher education access and succeed in college by working with them throughout high school (starting in the 9th grade). Their work focuses on students in the [Oakland Unified School District](//www.ousd.org/ousd), which was perfect for me.

** Volunteer Commitment **

I signed up to be a mentor to a future college student, and I was immediately surprised by the time I needed to invest in the program before officially becoming a mentor. Because the national graduate rate of the student population that the EBCF targets is only 20%, they are serious about their mentor-mentee matching process. They interviewed me to get an idea about my personality, my interests, and my beliefs. I entered the interview thinking -- "Sure, I could be a good mentor" and left thinking "Hmmmm, maybe I'm not what they're looking for." 

Well, I'm human and it turns out that's what they're looking for -- whew! It also turns out that they are very good at matching mentors with student mentees. I was matched with a quiet young Mexican woman from East Oakland, who was interested in majoring in engineering in college. Putting two introverts together always makes for an interesting first conversation - it's 80% silence and that didn't really bother either one of us. When we did start talking, there was a lot of excitement as we talked about our mutual interest in programming, photography, and, of course, engineering. 

I have been with the program for almost a year, and my mentee is still working through her first year as a mechanical engineering student at the University of California. The additional 'volunteer time' required for the program, which is actually quite minimal now (minimum of one phone call a month), has helped strengthen our relationship. Her first-year struggles brought back memories of when I was a college student receiving my first non-A. That devastating blow to my ego and made me think that engineering may not be the major for me, but I persisted. Sometimes you need someone that has been on the same path to let you know it's Ok and it gets better ahead!
